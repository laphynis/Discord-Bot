# Discord-Bot
Multi-purpose discord bot for a discord server

Before running, make sure to insert all the information that is specific to your discord server. In the script, it will tell you where to insert the information. For example,
it will say 'insert channel id here' which means that you can input a channel ID from a channel on your server.
